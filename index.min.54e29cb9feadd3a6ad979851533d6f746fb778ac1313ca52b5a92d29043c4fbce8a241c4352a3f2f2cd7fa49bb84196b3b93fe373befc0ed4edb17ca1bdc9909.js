The second parameter is the class itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inheritance of the creator class can be a little bit strange, but it is required and needed to register the class automatically with the factory. When the code gets compiled, the classes will be automatically registered with the factory, and you can create instances of those classes by using the name we\u0026rsquo;ve defined in the first template parameter. For example we could create a new instance of our previously created class with the following command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class="language-ts"\u003eAlgorithm * anotherAlgorithm = Factory\u0026lt;Algorithm\u0026gt;::getInstance()-\u0026gt;create(\u0026quot;AnotherAlgorithm\u0026quot;);\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch4 id="create-the-source-file"\u003eCreate the source file\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfcourse we also need to have an implementation file, therefore we need to create a new source file in the src/kerberos/machinery/algorithm directory. Just like the previous example, you can copy an existing class and implement the member functions you\u0026rsquo;ve declared in the header file.

It\u0026rsquo;s an image processing framework, written in C++, who benefits from other third party libraries (OpenCV, etc). It takes images from the type of camera (USB-, IP- or RPi-camera) you\u0026rsquo;ve configured in the configuration files and executes one ore more algorithms and post-processes (e.g. save a snapshot). The configuration files allow you to define the type of camera, post-processes, conditions and much more; it\u0026rsquo;s highly configurable. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the machinery, out-of-the-box, can handle only one camera at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id="project-structure"\u003eProject structure\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe machinery is an image processing framework which is devided into four steps:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003econdition\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ealgorithm\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eexpositor\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eheuristic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe steps belong to a four passway; illustrated on the image below. In each cycle a sequence of images is processed. Each step will process the sequence, and will return some result to the next step. For example: an algorithm will process the images and returns an array to the Expositor, which contains boolean values. The steps are loosly coupled, so they have simple conventions, just like the example before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to the loosly coupling, each step can be developed indepently. So algorithms, expositors, heuristics and conditions can be switched on the fly. This makes it easier for other developers who want to contribute to the machinery. They can create a new algorithm without knowing how a specific expositor or heuristic works. They just need to be aware of the convention an algorithm should meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src="../../public/images/machinery/project_structure.png" alt="machinery project structure"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese different steps can be configured by editing a couple of configurationn files located at \u003ccode\u003econfig/\u003c/code\u003e.

Please note that there are several different combinations of substracting images.

Next we will do a first comparision (C-B) of the third (C) image and the second (B) image, and after that we will do a second comparison (C-A) of the third (C) image and first (A) image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the comparison we will end up with two difference images (C-B) and (C-A); both will mark the white pixels as changed pixels and black as non-changed pixels.

The idea of the eroding is that pixels which are isolated will be removed; this means that when only one pixel changed, that pixel will reverted to the non-changed state.

Of course we will also have values between 0-255, so pixels that are a little bit different in both images. So to make the resulting black and white image, we will need to apply a threshold value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe threshold will specify how much a pixel has to be different in the two images.

Why a mono repo?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have noticed in the past (v1 and v2) splitting the repositories (machinery and web), created a lot of confusion within our community. People didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the different versions and so on. This caused a lack of collaboration, and made it impossible for some people to collaborate and contribute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving a mono repo, which is well organised, simplifies the entry point for new people who would like to use, understand and/or contribute to Kerberos Open Source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id="2-why-a-change-in-technologies"\u003e2. Why a change in technologies?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn previous versions (v1 and v2) we used technologies like C++, PHP and BackboneJS. 7 years ago this was still acceptable, however time has changed and new technologies such as React and Golang became very popular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to previous reason we have decided to rebuild the Kerberos Open Source technology from scratch, taking into account all the feedback we acquired over the years. Having these technologies available, we will enable more people to contribute and use our technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id="3-what-is-the-difference-with-kerberos-enterprise"\u003e3. What is the difference with Kerberos Enterprise?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started the developments of Kerberos Enterprise a year ago (January, 2020), our focus here was scalability, and fast development and easy deployment. We noticed that with technologies such as Golang and React, we can still provide a highly performant video surveillance system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKerberos Open Source will use the same technology stack, and some code pieces, of Kerberos Enterprise which we have already build. We have a very clear now, of how a well developed and documented video surveillance system needs to look like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id="4-when-are-we-going-to-be-able-to-install-the-first-version"\u003e4. When are we going to be able to install the first version?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe plan to ship the \u003cstrong\u003efirst version by the end of Q1\u003c/strong\u003e, afterwards we will add more and more features as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id="5-change-in-license"\u003e5.
